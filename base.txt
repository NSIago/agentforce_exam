Universal Containers (UC) needs to create a custom prompt template that can be
called from a Lightning web component.
Which prompt template type should UC create?
A. Field Generation
B. Sales Email
C. Flex
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AgentForce Developer Integration Guide specifies that Flex prompt
templates are the correct type for custom or embedded integrations, such as
invoking a prompt from a Lightning Web Component (LWC).
Flex templates are designed for general-purpose use cases and can be called
programmatically via Apex, Flow, or LWC APIs. They offer flexible input and
output structures, allowing developers to integrate AgentForce reasoning into

     




custom applications and UI components.
Option A, Field Generation, is used to populate or update Salesforce fields, not
for external invocation.
Option B, Sales Email, is specific to generating pre-formatted communication
messages and cannot be invoked directly from LWCs.
Therefore, the correct template type for a prompt used within a Lightning Web
Component is Option C C Flex, as it is purpose-built for dynamic, reusable, and
programmatic use cases.

Lightning Web Components.”


2.An Agentforce Specialist needs to create a prompt template to fill a custom field
named Latest Opportunities Summary on the Account object with information
from the three most recently opened opportunities.
How should the Agentforce Specialist gather the necessary data for the prompt
template?
A. Select the latest Opportunities related list as a merge field.
B. Create a flow to retrieve the opportunity information.
C. Select the Account Opportunity object as a resource when creating the prompt
template.
Answer: B
Explanation:
In Salesforce Agentforce, a prompt template designed to populate a custom field
(like "Latest Opportunities Summary" on the Account object) requires dynamic
data to be fed into the template for AI to generate meaningful output. Here, the
task is to gather data from the three most recently opened opportunities related
to an account. The most robust and flexible way to achieve this is by using a
Flow (Option B). Salesforce Flows allow the Agentforce Specialist to define logic
to query the Opportunity object, filter for the three most recent opportunities (e.g.,
using a Get Records element with a sort by CreatedDate descending and a limit
of 3), and pass this data as variables into the prompt template. This approach
ensures precise control over the data retrieval process and can handle complex
filtering or sorting requirements.
Option A: Selecting the "latest Opportunities related list as a merge field" is not a
valid option in Agentforce prompt templates. Merge fields can pull basic field data
(e.g., {!Account.Name}), but they don’t natively support querying or aggregating
related list data like the three most recent opportunities.
Option C: There is no "Account Opportunity object" in Salesforce; this seems to
be a misnomer (perhaps implying the Opportunity object or a junction object).
Even if interpreted as selecting the Opportunity object as a resource, prompt


                




templates don’t directly query related objects without additional logic (e.g., a
Flow), making this incorrect.
Option B: Flows integrate seamlessly with prompt templates via dynamic inputs,
allowing the Specialist to retrieve and structure the exact data needed (e.g.,
Opportunity Name, Amount, Close Date) for the AI to summarize.
Thus, Option B is the correct method to gather the necessary data efficiently and
accurately.

3.Based on the user utterance, 'Show me all the customers in New York', which
standard Agent action will the planner service use?
A. Query Records
B. Fetch Records
C. Select Records
Answer: A
Explanation:
Why is Query Records the Correct Answer?
In Agentforce, the Planner Service is responsible for interpreting user requests
and selecting the appropriate Copilot Action to fulfill them. When a user issues a
command like:
"Show me all the customers in New York",
the system must retrieve a list of customers filtered by location.
The Query Records action is designed precisely for this purpose.
Key Features of Query Records in Agentforce:
Retrieves Data Based on Specific Field Values
This action fetches Salesforce records that match a set of criteria, such as
customers located in New York.
Uses standard or custom object fields (e.g., BillingState = 'New York').
Works with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Copilot Actions
When a user asks for filtered data, Query Records is the default action assigned
by the Planner Service.
Optimized for Structured Data Retrieval
Ensures AI retrieves relevant CRM records quickly and accurately.
Why Not the Other Options?
? B. Fetch Records
This is not a standard term in Einstein Copilot or Agentforce.

No defined Agentforce action exists under this name.
? C. Select Records
Select Records is used to pick records from an already presented list, not to
retrieve them initially.
If the user had already retrieved records and wanted to refine their selection,
Select Records might be appropriate.
However, since the user's request is to retrieve records, Query Records is the
correct action.
Agentforce Specialist Reference
This information is confirmed from the Salesforce AI Specialist Material and
Questions Document, where the Query Records action is explicitly defined as the
appropriate standard action for retrieving filtered CRM records.


4.Choose 1 option.
An administrator at Universal Containers has successfully deployed a new agent
from a sandbox to production using a change set.
The agent uses a prompt template that invokes a Salesforce flow to perform a
complex calculation. In production, when users interact with the agent, it fails with
an error message every time the flow is supposed to run. The flow was included
in the change set and is present in production.
What is the most likely cause of this issue?
A. The flow was not manually activated in the production org after the
deployment.
B. The user in production does not have permission to run the flow.
C. The change set did not include the dependent Apex classes for the flow.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Per the AgentForce Deployment and Flow Integration Guide, when deploying
flows via change sets, the flows arrive in the production org in “inactive” status
by default. The administrator must manually activate the flow post-deployment
before it can be executed by agents or users.
This explains why the agent encounters an error when attempting to run the
flow?the system recognizes the flow but cannot invoke it because it remains
inactive.
Option B is incorrect since permission errors would display an “insufficient
privileges” message, not a runtime failure.
Option C is unlikely because dependent Apex classes would be automatically
handled if properly included in the deployment.
Therefore, the most likely cause is Option A C The flow was not manually
activated in production after deployment.

emails based on customer behavior, preferences, and purchase history.
Why should the team use Agent as the solution?
A. To generate relevant content when engaging with each customer
B. To analyze past campaign performance
C. To send automated emails to all customers
Answer: A
Explanation:
Agent is designed to assist in generating personalized, AI-driven content based
on customer data such as behavior, preferences, and purchase history. For the
marketing team at Universal Containers, this is the perfect solution to create
dynamic and relevant email content. By leveraging Agent, they can ensure that
each customer receives tailored communications, improving engagement and

7.Universal Containers (UC) is expanding its Agentforce for Service capabilities
to include case management. For security purposes, UC wants the agent to
verify a customer's identity before providing any case-related information. The
verification must be deterministic-ensuring that no case details are shared unless
identity verification has been successfully completed.
Which approach best meets this requirement?
A. Use keywords such as "Always" and "Never" to write clear logic in Topic
Instructions to verify user identity before providing any case information,
B. Create a variable to store the verification status, set it as output from a “Verify
Identity” action, and apply a filter so any case-related actions only run when the
variable confirms verification.
C. Store the verification status in a custom variable and set a global instruction
that the agent should check this variable before sharing case information.
Answer: B
Explanation:
The AgentForce for Service Implementation Guide clearly outlines that when an
agent must verify identity before performing any case-related operations, the
correct method is to use a variable-based control flow. The documentation
specifies: “To maintain deterministic and secure behavior, define a variable (for
example, ‘isVerified’) that stores the result of an identity verification step. Use
this variable as a conditional filter in the topic flow to ensure that case-related
actions execute only when the variable equals ‘true’.”
This ensures that no sensitive or case-specific data is shared unless verification
is explicitly confirmed. It provides a deterministic safeguard, as the system only
proceeds with case data actions after the verification variable confirms
completion.
Option A (“Use keywords such as ‘Always’ and ‘Never’”) relies on natural
language instructions, which are not deterministic and can be misinterpreted by
the model.
Option C (“Use a global instruction to check the variable”) adds unnecessary
complexity and lacks the control-level filtering that ensures secure flow logic.
Therefore, Option B correctly implements Salesforce’s best-practice pattern for
conditional execution using variables and filters in AgentForce.

8.Universal Containers (UC) wants to ensure the effectiveness, reliability, and
trust of its agents prior to deploying them in production. UC would like to
efficiently test a large and repeatable number of utterances.
What should the Agentforce Specialist recommend?
A. Leverage the Agent Large Language Model (LLM) UI and test UC's agents
with different utterances prior to activating the agent.
B. Deploy the agent in a QA sandbox environment and review the Utterance
Analysis reports to review effectiveness.
C. Create a CSV file with UC's test cases in Agentforce Testing Center using the
testing template.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The goal of Universal Containers (UC) is to test its Agentforce agents for
effectiveness, reliability, and trust before production deployment, with a focus on
efficiently handling a large and repeatable number of utterances. Let’s evaluate
each option against this requirement and Salesforce’s official Agentforce tools
and best practices.
Option A: Leverage the Agent Large Language Model (LLM) UI and test UC's
agents with different utterances prior to activating the agent.
While Agentforce leverages advanced reasoning capabilities (powered by the
Atlas Reasoning Engine), there’s no specific "Agent Large Language Model
(LLM) UI" referenced in Salesforce documentation for testing agents. Testing
utterances directly within an LLM interface might imply manual experimentation,
but this approach lacks scalability and repeatability for a large number of
utterances. It’s better suited for ad-hoc testing of individual responses rather
than systematic evaluation, making it inefficient for UC’s needs.
Option B: Deploy the agent in a QA sandbox environment and review the
Utterance Analysis reports to review effectiveness.
Deploying an agent in a QA sandbox is a valid step in the development lifecycle,
as sandboxes allow testing in a production-like environment without affecting live
data. However, "Utterance Analysis reports" is not a standard term in Agentforce
documentation. Salesforce provides tools like Agent Analytics or User Utterances
dashboards for post-deployment analysis, but these are more about monitoring
live performance than pre-deployment testing. This option doesn’t explicitly
address how to efficiently test a large and repeatable number of utterances
before deployment, making it less precise for UC’s requirement.

Option C: Create a CSV file with UC's test cases in Agentforce Testing Center
using the testing template.
The Agentforce Testing Center is a dedicated tool within Agentforce Studio
designed specifically for testing autonomous AI agents. According to Salesforce
documentation, Testing Center allows users to
upload a CSV file containing test cases (e.g., utterances and expected
outcomes) using a provided template. This enables the generation and execution
of hundreds of synthetic interactions in parallel, simulating real-world scenarios.
The tool evaluates how the agent interprets utterances, selects topics, and
executes actions, providing detailed results for iteration. This aligns perfectly with
UC’s need for efficiency (bulk testing via CSV), repeatability (standardized test
cases), and reliability (systematic validation), ensuring the agent is production-
ready. This is the recommended approach per official guidelines.
Why Option C is Correct:
The Agentforce Testing Center is explicitly built for pre-deployment validation of
agents. It supports bulk testing by allowing users to upload a CSV with
utterances, which is then processed by the Atlas Reasoning Engine to assess
accuracy and reliability. This method ensures UC can systematically test a large
dataset, refine agent instructions or topics based on results, and build trust in the
agent’s performance?all before production deployment. This aligns with
Salesforce’s emphasis on testing non-deterministic AI systems efficiently, as
noted in Agentforce setup documentation and Trailhead modules.

9.For an Agentforce Data Library that contains uploaded files, what occurs once
it is created and configured?
A. Indexes the uploaded files in a location specified by the user
B. Indexes the uploaded files into Data Cloud
C. Indexes the uploaded files in Salesforce File Storage
Answer: B
Explanation:
In Salesforce Agentforce, a Data Library is a feature that allows organizations to
upload files (e.g., PDFs, documents) to be used as grounding data for AI-driven


                Help You Pass Easily | Money Back Guarantee | Free Update in 3 Months | PDF & SOFT
                                            www.itfreedumps.com




agents. Once the Data Library is created and configured, the uploaded files are
indexed to make their content searchable and usable by the AI (e.g., for retrieval-
augmented generation or prompt enhancement). The key question is where this
indexing occurs. Salesforce Agentforce integrates tightly with Data Cloud, a
unified data platform that includes a vector database optimized for storing and
indexing unstructured data like uploaded files. When a Data Library is set up, the
files are ingested and indexed into Data Cloud’s vector database, enabling the
AI to efficiently retrieve relevant information from them during conversations or
actions.
Option A: Indexing files in a "location specified by the user" is not a feature of
Agentforce Data Libraries. The indexing process is managed by Salesforce
infrastructure, not a user-defined location.
Option B: This is correct. Data Cloud handles the indexing of uploaded files,
storing them in its vector database to support AI capabilities like semantic search
and content retrieval.
Option C: Salesforce File Storage (e.g., where ContentVersion records are
stored) is used for general file storage, but it does not inherently index files for AI
use. Agentforce relies on Data Cloud for indexing, not basic file storage.
Thus, Option B accurately reflects the process after a Data Library is created and
configured in Agentforce.

10. Why Fine-Tune an Einstein AI Model with CRM Data?
o Company-Specific Relevance: By fine-tuning Einstein AI with UC’s CRM data
(accounts, opportunities, products, and historical interactions), the model learns
the enterprise-specific context. This ensures that the generative outputs are
accurate and tailored to UC’s sales scenarios.
o Security and Compliance: Using Salesforce Einstein within the Salesforce
ecosystem keeps data under UC’s control, aligning with trust, security, and
compliance requirements.
o Better Predictions: Einstein AI can produce more relevant insights (e.g.,
recommended next steps, content suggestions, or AI-generated email
responses) when it has been trained on real, high-quality internal data.

13.Choose 1 option.
Coral Cloud Resorts is implementing Agentforce retrieval. Customers sometimes
type ambiguous terms (for example, “package” could mean vacation package or
baggage).
Which retrieval strategy best balances precision and contextual disambiguation?
A. Use hybrid search, which combines keyword matching for precision with
semantic embeddings for context.
B. Use semantic search only, which captures intent but may struggle with
ambiguous terms when no context is provided.
C. Use keyword search only, which prioritizes exact term matching but risks
missing contextual meaning.
Answer: A
Explanation:
According to the AgentForce Retrieval Optimization Guide, when handling
ambiguous search terms such as “package,” which may refer to multiple
concepts, the recommended approach is to use hybrid search. The
documentation defines hybrid search as: “A combined retrieval method that
leverages keyword-based precision and semantic embeddings to capture
contextual intent. This approach ensures high recall while maintaining exact-term
precision.”
This method allows AgentForce to resolve ambiguity by using semantic context
to interpret meaning while maintaining keyword-based precision for deterministic
matching.
The guide further notes:
“Hybrid retrieval offers the optimal balance between contextual understanding
and exact-term accuracy, especially in multi-domain or ambiguous queries.”
In contrast, semantic search only may misinterpret terms without adequate

context, and keyword search only lacks the contextual reasoning to differentiate
between meanings. Thus, Option A aligns with Salesforce’s documented best
practice for retrieval precision and contextual relevance.

14.Coral Cloud Resorts (CCR) uses Agentforce to assist customers with booking
and service issues.
CCR wants to implement a triage process 50 that:
* High severity requests must be escalated to a human service rep.
* Lower severity requests should result in creating a support case for the guest.
The requirement is to achieve the highest reliability and determinism in the
response from the agent.
Which approach should an Agentforce Specialist recommend?
A. Write the triage and routing logic in Topic Instructions using an IF, THEN,
ELSE pattern: “Escalate to human service rep if the request is considered
severe, otherwise create support case”.
B. Use absolute keywords like “Always" and “Never” in Topic Instructions to
enforce logic, such as “Always escalate when severity is high” and “Never
create a support case when severity is high”.
C. Create a custom variable severityLevel populated by a Triage action. Add
filters so the “Escalate to human service rep” action only runs when
severityLevel = ‘High’, and the “Create Support Case” action runs only when
severityLevel != ‘High’.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AgentForce Conditional Logic and Triage Design Guide recommends using
custom variables and deterministic filters for reliable decision-making in AI
agents. The document explains: “For deterministic triage flows, create a variable
(e.g., severityLevel) populated by an action or rule. Then, apply filters so that
specific actions execute only when the variable matches defined criteria. This
approach guarantees predictable and auditable outcomes.”
In this case, severityLevel controls whether to escalate to a human rep or create
a support case, ensuring no ambiguity in execution.
Option A (IF/THEN logic in topic instructions) and Option B (“Always/Never”
keywords) rely on natural language interpretation, which is non-deterministic and
can lead to inconsistent results.
Thus, Option C aligns with Salesforce’s documented best practice for reliable

15.Universal Containers wants to keep retrieval accurate as product
documentation changes frequently.
Which approach should the company implement?
A. Leave embedding unchanged even if content is updated.
B. Rebuild the search index.
C. Manually delete the stale data chunks.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Comprehensive and Detailed Explanation From Exact Extract of AgentForce
Documents:
According to the official AgentForce implementation guidelines and RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture within Salesforce, maintaining
retrieval accuracy depends on ensuring that embeddings and indexed content
remain synchronized with the most recent data. When product documentation or
knowledge base content changes, the underlying text used for vector
embeddings must also be updated to reflect the new information.
The AgentForce documentation clearly specifies that when content is modified,
the recommended practice is to rebuild the search index. This process
regenerates the document chunks, re-embeds them using the latest model, and
updates the index used by the retrieval system. This ensures that queries return
the most current and relevant responses aligned with the updated content.
Leaving embeddings unchanged (Option A) would cause retrievals to surface
outdated or irrelevant information, as the underlying semantic representations
would no longer match the source material. Similarly, manually deleting stale
data chunks (Option C) does not ensure a full refresh of vector data and can lead
to incomplete or inconsistent results.
Therefore, as per AgentForce best practices, the correct approach is Option B C
Rebuild the search index, ensuring that all embeddings, chunks, and indexed
data are aligned with the latest version of the content.

17.Which object stores the conversation transcript between the customer and the
agent?
A. Messaging End User
B. Messaging Session
C. Case
Answer: B
Explanation:
Why is "Messaging Session" the correct answer?
In Agentforce, the Messaging Session object stores the conversation transcript
between the customer and the agent.
Key Features of the Messaging Session Object:
Stores the Entire Customer-Agent Conversation
The Messaging Session object maintains a record of the full chat history,
including timestamps, messages, and interactions.
This ensures that past interactions can be referenced during follow-ups.
Supports AI-Powered Work Summaries
Einstein AI uses Messaging Sessions to generate summaries of chat interactions
for agents.
These summaries are stored and accessible for later reference.
Links with Service Cloud for Case Resolution
If a conversation escalates into a case, the Messaging Session object can be
linked to it.
This allows support teams to review the conversation history without switching
contexts.
Why Not the Other Options?
? A. Messaging End User
Incorrect because this object stores details about the customer (e.g., name,
contact details) but not the conversation transcript.
? C. Case
Incorrect because Cases store structured service requests but do not contain raw
conversation transcripts.

18.Universal Containers recently launched a pilot program to integrate
conversational AI into its CRM business operations with Agentforce Agents.
How should the Agentforce Specialist monitor Agents’ usability and the
assignment of actions?
A. Run a report on the Platform Debug Logs.
B. Query the Agent log data using the Metadata API.
C. Run Agent Analytics.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Monitoring the usability and action assignments of Agentforce Agents requires
insights into how
agents perform, how users interact with them, and how actions are executed
within conversations. Salesforce provides Agent Analytics (Option C) as a built-in
capability specifically designed for this purpose. Agent Analytics offers
dashboards and reports that track metrics such as agent response times, user
satisfaction, action invocation frequency, and success rates. This tool allows the
Agentforce Specialist to assess usability (e.g., are agents meeting user needs?)
and monitor action assignments (e.g., which actions are triggered and how
often), providing actionable data to optimize the pilot program.
Option A: Platform Debug Logs are low-level logs for troubleshooting Apex,
Flows, or system processes. They don’t provide high-level insights into agent
usability or action assignments, making this unsuitable.
Option B: The Metadata API is used for retrieving or deploying metadata (e.g.,
object definitions), not runtime log data about agent performance. While Agent
log data might exist, querying it via Metadata API is not a standard or
documented approach for this use case.

19.Universal Containers’ current AI data masking rules do not align with
organizational privacy and security policies and requirements.
What should An Agentforce recommend to resolve the issue?
A. Enable data masking for sandbox refreshes.
B. Configure data masking in the Einstein Trust Layer setup.
C. Add new data masking rules in LLM setup.
Answer: B
Explanation:
When Universal Containers' AI data masking rules do not meet organizational
privacy and security standards, the Agentforce Specialist should configure the
data masking rules within the Einstein Trust Layer. The Einstein Trust Layer
provides a secure and compliant environment where sensitive data can be
masked or anonymized to adhere to privacy policies and regulations.
Option A, enabling data masking for sandbox refreshes, is related to sandbox
environments, which are separate from how AI interacts with production data.
Option C, adding masking rules in the LLM setup, is not appropriate because
data masking is managed through the Einstein Trust Layer, not the LLM
configuration.
The Einstein Trust Layer allows for more granular control over what data is
exposed to the AI model and ensures compliance with privacy regulations.

20.Universal Containers (UC) has a mature Salesforce org with a lot of data in
cases and Knowledge articles. UC is concerned that there are many legacy
fields, with data that might not be applicable for Einstein AI to draft accurate
email responses.
Which solution should UC use to ensure Einstein AI can draft responses from a
defined data source?
A. Service AI Grounding
B. Work Summaries
C. Service Replies
Answer: A
Explanation:
Service AI Grounding is the solution that Universal Containers should use to
ensure Einstein AI drafts responses based on a well-defined data source. Service

                                           www.itfreedumps.com




AI Grounding allows the AI model to be anchored in specific, relevant data
sources, ensuring that any AI-generated responses (e.g., email replies) are
accurate, relevant, and drawn from up-to-date information, such as Knowledge
articles or cases.
Given that UC has legacy fields and outdated data, Service AI Grounding
ensures that only the valid and applicable data is used by Einstein AI to craft
responses. This helps improve the relevance of responses and avoids
inaccuracies caused by outdated or irrelevant fields.
Work Summaries and Service Replies are useful features but do not address the
need for grounding AI outputs in specific, current data sources like Service AI
Grounding does.
For more details, you can refer to Salesforce’s Service AI Grounding
documentation for managing AI-generated content based on accurate data
sources.


21.In addition to Recipient and Sender, which object should An Agentforce utilize
for inserting merge fields into a Sales email template prompt?
A. Recipient Opportunities
B. Recipient Account
C. User Organization
Answer: B
Explanation:
Sales Email Template Use Case:
When creating a Sales email template (especially for outreach or follow-up), you
often need to reference relevant details about the Account linked to the recipient.
Standard Merge Fields in Salesforce Email Templates:
Recipient (Contact, Lead, or Person receiving the email)
Sender (User sending the email)
Recipient Account (the Account related to that Contact, providing company-level
details and other relevant data)
Why Recipient Account?
For Sales communications, referencing the Account data (e.g., Account name,
industry, or other custom fields) in an email is very common.
This is especially important for B2B scenarios where the Contact is tied to an
Account.
“Recipient Opportunities” could be multiple, so it’s less direct for standard email
merges. The “User Organization” is more generic internal information, not
typically inserted for personalization to the recipient.

22.Leadership needs to populate a dynamic form field with a summary or
description created by a large language model (LLM) to facilitate more productive
conversations with customers. Leadership also wants to keep a human in the
loop to be considered in their AI strategy.
Which prompt template type should the Agentforce Specialist recommend?
A. Field Generation
B. Sales Email
C. Record Summary
Answer: A
Explanation:
Why is "Field Generation" the correct answer?
In Agentforce, the Field Generation prompt template type is designed to populate
dynamic form fields with AI-generated content, such as summaries or
descriptions created by a large language model (LLM).
Key Considerations for Using Field Generation in Dynamic Forms:
AI-Powered Summarization in Form Fields
Field Generation templates allow real-time AI-generated summaries based on
customer data.
The summary is dynamically populated in the form field for the sales or service
representative to review.
Human-in-the-Loop AI Strategy
Since leadership wants a human to be involved, Field Generation ensures the AI-
generated content is editable before submission.
This keeps a human-in-the-loop, allowing manual review before finalizing
responses.
Works with Salesforce Dynamic Forms
Field Generation templates integrate seamlessly with Salesforce Dynamic Forms,
ensuring AI-powered insights are embedded within form layouts.
Why Not the Other Options?
? B. Sales Email
Incorrect because Sales Email templates are designed for AI-generated email
content, not for populating form fields.
? C. Record Summary
Incorrect because Record Summary templates generate high-level summaries of
entire records, but do not populate individual form fields dynamically.

23.Universal Containers has a strict change management process that requires
all possible configuration to be completed in a sandbox which will be deployed to
production. The Agentforce Specialist is tasked with setting up Work Summaries
for Enhanced Messaging. Einstein Generative AI is already enabled in
production, and the Einstein Work Summaries permission set is already available
in production.
Which other configuration steps should the Agentforce Specialist take in the
sandbox that can be deployed to the production org?
A. create custom fields to store Issue, Resolution, and Summary; create a Quick
Action that updates these fields: add the Wrap Up component to the Messaging
Session record paae layout: and create Permission Set Assignments for the
intended Agents.
B. From the Epstein setup menu, select Turn on Einstein: create custom fields to
store Issue, Resolution, and Summary: create a Quick Action that updates these
fields: and add the wrap up componert to the Messaging session record page
layout.
C. Create custom fields to store issue, Resolution, and Summary; create a Quick
Action that updates these fields: and ado the Wrap up component to the
Messaging session record page lavcut.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Context of the Question
Universal Containers (UC) has a strict change management process that
requires all possible configuration be completed in a sandbox and deployed to
Production.
Einstein Generative AI is already enabled in Production, and the “Einstein Work
Summaries” permission set is already available in Production.
The Agentforce Specialist needs to configure Work Summaries for Enhanced
Messaging in the sandbox.
What Can Actually Be Deployed from Sandbox to Production?
Custom Fields: Metadata that is easily created in sandbox and then deployed.
Quick Actions: Also metadata-based and can be deployed from sandbox to
production.
Layout Components: Page layout changes (such as adding the Wrap Up
component) can be added to a change set or deployment package.
Why Option C is Correct

                                           www.itfreedumps.com




No Need to Turn on Einstein in Sandbox for Deployment: Einstein Generative AI
is already enabled in Production; turning it on in the sandbox is typically a manual
step if you want to test, but that step itself is not “deployable” in the sense of
metadata.
Permission Set Assignments (as in Option A) are not deployable metadata. You
can deploy the Permission Set itself but not the specific user assignments. Since
the question specifically asks “Which other configuration steps should be taken
in the sandbox that can be deployed to the production org?”, user assignment is
not one of them.
Why Not Option A or B?
Option A: Mentions creating permission set assignments for agents. This cannot
be directly deployed from sandbox to Production, as permission set assignments
are user-specific and considered “data,” not metadata.
Option B: Mentions “Turn on Einstein.” But Einstein Generative AI is already
enabled in Production.
Additionally, “Turning on Einstein” is typically an org-level setting, not a
deployable metadata item.
Conclusion
The main deployable items you can reliably create and test in a sandbox, and
then migrate to
Production, are:
Custom Fields (Issue, Resolution, Summary).
A Quick Action that updates those fields.
Page Layout Change to include the Wrap Up component.
Therefore, Option C is correct and focuses on actions that are truly deployable as
metadata from a sandbox to Production.

25.Choose 1 option.
Universal Containers has a requirement to provide a sales summary for its sales
reps who are using Employee Agents, but they are not happy with the default
answer.
Which best practice should the AgentForce Specialist recommend?
A. Create a Record Summary custom prompt template.
B. Create a Knowledge Answer custom prompt template.
C. Update the standard record summary action.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Comprehensive and Detailed Explanation From Exact Extract of AgentForce
Documents:
According to the AgentForce Prompt Customization and Template Development
Guide, when an organization wants to modify or enhance how structured data
(like Salesforce records) is summarized or presented by an agent, the correct
approach is to create a Record Summary custom prompt template.
Record Summary templates allow specialists to tailor how the agent interprets
and communicates record information ? such as opportunities, accounts, or sales
summaries ? ensuring the output aligns with company-specific terminology, tone,
and data needs.
Option B, the Knowledge Answer template, is used when the agent must answer
queries grounded in unstructured text sources (e.g., Knowledge articles), not
structured CRM data.
Option C, updating the standard record summary action, is not recommended
because it may impact other agents or system actions globally, and Salesforce

documentation advises customizing through new templates instead of overwriting
defaults.

26.Universal Containers (UC) would like to implement the Sales Development
Representative (SDR) Agent.
Which channel consideration should UC be aware of while implementing it?
A. SDR Agent must be deployed in the Messaging channel.
B. SDR Agent only works in the Email channel.
C. SDR Agent must also be deployed on the company website.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Universal Containers (UC) is implementing the Agentforce Sales Development
Representative (SDR) Agent, a prebuilt AI agent designed to qualify leads and
schedule meetings. Channel considerations are critical for deployment. Let’s
evaluate the options based on official Salesforce documentation.
Option A: SDR Agent must be deployed in the Messaging channel.
The Agentforce SDR Agent is designed to engage prospects in real-time
conversations, primarily through the Messaging channel (e.g., Salesforce
Messaging for in-app or web chat). This aligns with its purpose of qualifying leads
interactively and scheduling meetings, as outlined in Agentforce for Sales
documentation. While it may leverage email for follow-ups, its core deployment
and interaction occur via Messaging, making this a key consideration UC must be
aware of. This is the correct answer.
Option B: SDR Agent only works in the Email channel.
The SDR Agent is not limited to email. While it can send emails (e.g., follow-ups
after lead qualification), its primary function?real-time lead engagement?relies on
Messaging. Stating it "only works in the Email channel" is inaccurate and
contradicts its documented capabilities, making this incorrect.
Option C: SDR Agent must also be deployed on the company website.
While the SDR Agent can be embedded on a company website via Messaging
(e.g., as a chat widget), this is an implementation choice, not a mandatory
requirement. The agent’s deployment is channel-specific (Messaging), and
website integration is optional, not a "must." This option overstates the
requirement, making it incorrect.
Why Option A is Correct:

                                           www.itfreedumps.com




The SDR Agent’s primary deployment in the Messaging channel is a
documented consideration for its real-time lead qualification capabilities. UC must
plan for this channel to ensure effective implementation, as per Salesforce
guidelines.

27.An Agentforce is creating a custom action for Agentforce.
Which setting should the a ensure the action performs as expected?
A. Action Name
B. Action Input
C. Action Instructions
Answer: C
Explanation:
When creating a custom action for Einstein Bots in Salesforce (including
Agentforce), Action Instructions are critical for defining how the bot processes
and executes the action. These instructions guide the bot on the logic to follow,
such as API calls, data transformations, or conditional steps. Testing and
iterating on the instructions ensures the bot understands how to handle dynamic
inputs, external integrations, and decision-making.
Salesforce documentation emphasizes that Action Instructions directly impact the
bot’s ability to execute workflows accurately. For example, poorly defined
instructions may lead to incorrect API payloads or failure to parse responses. The
Einstein Bot Developer Guide highlights that refining instructions is essential for
aligning the bot’s behavior with business requirements.
In contrast:
Action Name (A) is a static identifier and does not affect functionality.
Action Input (B) defines parameters passed to the action but does not dictate
execution logic.
Thus, iterating on Action Instructions (C) ensures the action performs as
expected.
Reference: Salesforce Help Article: Create Custom Actions for Einstein Bots
Einstein Bot Developer Guide: "Custom Action Configuration Best Practices"
(Section 4.3).

28.Universal Containers wants to incorporate the current order fulfillment status
into a prompt for a large language model (LLM). The order status is stored in the
external enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Which data grounding technique should the Agentforce Specialist recommend?
A. Eternal Object Record Merge Fields
B. External Services Merge Fields
C. Apex Merge Fields
Answer: A
Explanation:
Context of the Requirement:
Universal Containers wants to pull in real-time order status data from an external
ERP system into an LLM prompt.
Data Grounding in LLM Prompts:
Data grounding ensures the Large Language Model has access to the most
current and relevant information. In Salesforce, one recommended approach is to
use External Objects (via Salesforce Connect) when data resides outside of
Salesforce.
Why External Object Record Merge Fields:
External Objects appear much like standard or custom objects but map to tables
in external systems.
You can reference fields from these External Objects in merge fields, allowing
real-time data retrieval from the external ERP system without storing that data
natively in Salesforce.
This is a simpler “point-and-reference” approach compared to coding custom
Apex or configuring external services for direct prompt embedding.
Why Not External Services Merge Fields or Apex Merge Fields:
External Services Merge Fields typically leverage flows or external service
definitions. While feasible, it is more about orchestrating or invoking external
services for automation (e.g., Flow). It’s not the standard approach for
seamlessly referencing external record data in prompt merges.
Apex Merge Fields would imply custom Apex code controlling the prompt
insertion. While possible, it’s less “clicks not code” friendly and is not the default
method for referencing typical record data.

up their order status.
The topic setup includes:
Name: Order Inquiry
Classification Description: Handles user requests to look up order status,
including tracking details and delivery estimates for orders placed within the last
90 days.
Scope: Your job is only to assist authenticated users in looking up the status of
their orders placed within the last 90 days. If the order is pending delivery,
provide the tracking number and estimated delivery date. Do not handle inquiries
for orders older than 90 days.
Which information will be used by the Agentforce reasoning engine to choose this
topic?
A. Topic Name and Classification Description
B. Topic Name and Scope
C. Classification Description and Scope
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AgentForce Reasoning Engine Guide explains that the engine relies
primarily on the Classification Description and Scope fields to determine which
topic best matches the user’s intent. The documentation notes: “Classification
Description defines the purpose and context of a topic, while Scope provides the
operational boundaries for when and how that topic should be triggered.
Together, they guide the LLM in selecting the appropriate topic at runtime.”
Option A includes “Topic Name,” which is used mainly for administrative
organization, not reasoning.
Option B omits the Classification Description, which contains the intent signal
critical for matching. Therefore, Option C is correct since both the Classification
Description and Scope are essential for topic selection by the reasoning engine.

30.What should An Agentforce consider when using related list merge fields in a
prompt template associated with an Account object in Prompt Builder?
A. The Activities related list on the Account object is not supported because it is a
polymorphic field.
B. If person accounts have been enabled, merge fields will not be available for
the Account object.


               Help You Pass Easily | Money Back Guarantee | Free Update in 3 Months | PDF & SOFT
                                            www.itfreedumps.com




C. Prompt generation will yield no response when there is no related list
associated with an Account in runtime.
Answer: A
Explanation:
When using related list merge fields in a prompt template associated with the
Account object in Prompt Builder, the Activities related list is not supported due to
it being a polymorphic field. Polymorphic fields can reference multiple different
types of objects, which makes them incompatible with some merge field
operations in prompt generation.
Option B is incorrect because person accounts do not limit the availability of
merge fields for the Account object.
Option C is irrelevant since even if no related lists are available at runtime, the
prompt can still generate based on other available data fields.
For more information, refer to Salesforce documentation on supported fields and
limitations in Prompt Builder.


31.How does an Agent respond when it can’t understand the request or find any
requested information?
A. With a preconfigured message, based on the action type.
B. With a general message asking the user to rephrase the request.
C. With a generated error message.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Agentforce Agents are designed to handle situations where they cannot interpret
a request or retrieve requested data gracefully. Let’s assess the options based
on Agentforce behavior.
Option A: With a preconfigured message, based on the action type.
While Agentforce allows customization of responses, there’s no specific
mechanism tying preconfigured messages to action types for unhandled
requests. Fallback responses are more general, not action-specific, making this
incorrect.
Option B: With a general message asking the user to rephrase the request.
When an Agentforce Agent fails to understand a request or find information, it
defaults to a general fallback response, typically asking the user to rephrase or
clarify their input (e.g., “I didn’t quite get that?could you try asking again?”). This
is configurable in Agent Builder but defaults to a user-friendly prompt to
encourage retry, aligning with Salesforce’s focus on conversational UX. This is
the correct answer per documentation.
Option C: With a generated error message.
Agentforce Agents prioritize user experience over technical error messages.

                                           www.itfreedumps.com




While errors might log internally (e.g., in Event Logs), the user-facing response
avoids jargon and focuses on retry prompts, making this incorrect.
Why Option B is Correct:
The default behavior of asking users to rephrase aligns with Agentforce’s
conversational design principles, ensuring a helpful response when
comprehension fails, as noted in official resources.

32.Universal Containers wants to utilize Agentforce for Sales to help sales reps
reach their sales quotas by providing AI-generated plans containing guidance
and steps for closing deals.
Which feature meets this requirement?
A. Create Account Plan
B. Find Similar Deals
C. Create Close Plan
Answer: C
Explanation:
Universal Containers (UC) aims to leverage Agentforce for Sales to assist sales
reps with AI-generated plans that provide guidance and steps for closing deals.
Let’s evaluate the options based on Agentforce for Sales features.
Option A: Create Account Plan
While account planning is valuable for long-term strategy, Agentforce for Sales
does not have a specific "Create Account Plan" feature focused on closing
individual deals. Account plans typically involve broader account-level insights,
not deal-specific closure steps, making this incorrect for UC’s requirement.
Option B: Find Similar Deals
"Find Similar Deals" is not a documented feature in Agentforce for Sales. It might
imply identifying past deals for reference, but it doesn’t involve generating plans
with guidance and steps for closing current deals. This option is incorrect and not
aligned with UC’s goal.
Option C: Create Close Plan
The "Create Close Plan" feature in Agentforce for Sales uses AI to generate a
detailed plan with actionable steps and guidance tailored to closing a specific
deal. Powered by the Atlas Reasoning Engine, it analyzes deal data (e.g.,
Opportunity records) and provides reps with a roadmap to meet quotas. This

directly meets UC’s requirement for AI-generated plans focused on deal closure,
making it the correct answer.
Why Option C is Correct:
"Create Close Plan" is a specific Agentforce for Sales capability designed to help
reps close deals with AI-driven plans, aligning perfectly with UC’s needs as per
Salesforce documentation.

33.An Agentforce is tasked to optimize a business process flow by assigning
actions to agents within the Salesforce Agentforce Platform.
What is the correct method for the Agentforce Specialist to assign actions to an
Agent?
A. Assign the action to a Topic First in Agent Builder.
B. Assign the action to a Topic first on the Agent Actions detail page.
C. Assign the action to a Topic first on Action Builder.
Answer: A
Explanation:
In the Salesforce Agentforce Platform, assigning actions to Agents requires
mapping them through Topics in Agent Builder. Topics act as the container that
links an Agent’s conversational intent with the specific actions it can perform. By
first assigning an action to a Topic in Agent Builder, the Agentforce Specialist
ensures that the Agent knows when and how to trigger the action during the
business process flow.


34.Universal Containers would like to route SMS text messages to a service rep
from an Agentforce Service Agent.
Which Service Channel should the company use in the flow to ensure it’s routed
properly?
A. Messaging
B. Route Work Action
C. Live Agent
Answer: A
Explanation:
UC wants to route SMS text messages from an Agentforce Service Agent to a
service rep using a flow.

                                           www.itfreedumps.com




Let’s identify the correct Service Channel.
Option A: Messaging
In Salesforce, the "Messaging" Service Channel (part of Messaging for In-App
and Web or SMS) handles text-based interactions, including SMS. When
integrated with Omni-Channel Flow, the "Route Work" action uses this channel to
route SMS messages to agents. This aligns with UC’s requirement for SMS
routing, making it the correct answer.
Option B: Route Work Action
"Route Work" is an action in Omni-Channel Flow, not a Service Channel. It uses
a channel (e.g., Messaging) to route work, so this is a component, not the
channel itself, making it incorrect.
Option C: Live Agent
"Live Agent" refers to an older chat feature, not the current Messaging framework
for SMS. It’s outdated and unrelated to SMS routing, making it incorrect.
Option D: SMS Channel
There’s no standalone "SMS Channel" in Salesforce Service Channels?SMS is
encompassed within the "Messaging" channel. This is a misnomer, making it
incorrect.
Why Option A is Correct:
The "Messaging" Service Channel supports SMS routing in Omni-Channel Flow,
ensuring proper handoff from the Agentforce Service Agent to a rep, per
Salesforce documentation.
Reference: Salesforce Agentforce Documentation: Omni-Channel Integration >
Messaging C Details SMS in Messaging channel.
Trailhead: Omni-Channel Flow Basics C Confirms Messaging for SMS.

35.Once a data source is chosen for an Agentforce Data Library, what is true
about changing that data source later?
A. The data source can be changed through the Data Cloud settings.
B. The Data Retriever can be reconfigured to use a different data source.
C. The data source cannot be changed after it is selected.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Why is "The data source cannot be changed after it is selected" the correct
answer?
When configuring an Agentforce Data Library, the data source selection is
permanent. Once a data source is set, it cannot be modified or replaced. This
design ensures data consistency, security, and reliability within Salesforce's AI-
driven environment.

Any updates or modifications require creating a new Data Library instead of
modifying the existing one.
Why Can't the Data Source Be Changed?
The data source defines the foundation of AI-driven workflows, and any
modification would disrupt processing logic.
Agentforce tools rely on structured datasets to enable AI-powered
recommendations, and changing data sources could lead to inconsistencies in
grounding techniques.
Workarounds for Changing Data Sources
If an organization needs to use a different data source, a new Agentforce Data
Library must be created and configured from scratch.
Old data can be manually migrated into the new data source for continuity.
Why Not the Other Options?
? A. The data source can be changed through the Data Cloud settings.
Incorrect because once the data source is linked to an Agentforce Data Library, it
cannot be altered, even via Data Cloud settings.
? B. The Data Retriever can be reconfigured to use a different data source.
Incorrect as the Data Retriever works within the constraints of the selected data
source and does not provide an option to swap data sources post-selection.
Agentforce Specialist Reference
The Salesforce AI Specialist Material and Salesforce Instructions for the
Certification confirm that once a data source is set for an Agentforce Data
Library, it cannot be changed.


36.An Agentforce wants to use the related lists from an account in a custom
prompt template.
What should the Agentforce Specialist consider when configuring the prompt
template?
A. The text encoding (for example, UTF-8, ASCII) option
B. The maximum number of related list merge fields
C. The choice between XML and JSON rendering formats for the list
Answer: B
Explanation:
When configuring a custom prompt template to use related lists, the Agentforce
Specialist must be aware of the maximum number of related list merge fields that
can be included. Salesforce enforces limits to ensure prompt templates perform

efficiently and do not overload the system with too much data. As a best practice,
it's important to monitor and optimize the number of merge fields used.
Option B is correct because there is a limit on how many related list merge fields
can be included in a prompt template.
Option A (text encoding) and Option C (XML/JSON rendering) are not key
considerations in this context.

37.Choose 1 option.
Universal Containers (UC) wants to ensure its compliance team can retrieve
exact matches of policy clause numbers from a structured legal document library.
Which search type should UC implement?
A. Use keyword search for exact term matching on structured fields like clause
numbers.
B. Use hybrid search to blend keyword and semantic recall.
C. Use semantic search to interpret synonyms of clauses dynamically.
Answer: A
Explanation:
According to the AgentForce Search Optimization Guide, when the use case
requires retrieving exact matches (such as policy clause numbers, legal
identifiers, or invoice IDs) from structured data, the recommended approach is to
use keyword search. The documentation specifies: “Keyword search ensures
deterministic retrieval of exact term matches from structured fields, preserving
precision for identifiers, numeric values, and code references.”
Semantic search (Option C) uses contextual understanding and synonym
expansion, which may yield near matches but not exact ones. Hybrid search
(Option B) combines both semantic and keyword results for general knowledge
retrieval, but it introduces probabilistic ranking?not suitable for exact
legal or compliance queries.
Therefore, for the compliance use case where exact clause number matching is
required, keyword search guarantees accuracy, speed, and compliance integrity.

38.An Agentforce Specialist wants to ensure their custom agent action performs
as expected in conversations.
What should the Agentforce Specialist focus on when creating action
instructions?
A. Write concise agent action instructions and test in Agentforce Builder.
B. Ensure the agent action label matches the utterance’s intent.
C. Include comprehensive detailed descriptions and perform smoke testing.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The AgentForce Action Design Guide emphasizes that concise and clear action
instructions are essential for predictable and reliable agent behavior. The
documentation states: “Action instructions should be concise, clearly define the
purpose of the action, and specify its expected inputs and outputs. Each action
must be validated through testing in AgentForce Builder to confirm the LLM
interprets and executes it as intended.”
This aligns with Option A, which focuses on clarity and testing.
Option B incorrectly focuses on label-intent matching, which is a naming best
practice but not sufficient for accuracy.
Option C promotes overly detailed instructions, which can lead to LLM confusion
and inconsistent results.
Therefore, Option A best aligns with Salesforce’s official best practices for
creating and validating custom actions.

39.Where should the Agentforce Specialist go to add/update actions assigned to
a copilot?
A. Copilot Actions page, the record page for the copilot action, or the Copilot
Action Library tab
B. Copilot Actions page or Global Actions
C. Copilot Detail page, Global Actions, or the record page for the copilot action
Answer: A
Explanation:
To add or update actions assigned to a copilot, An Agentforce can manage this
through several areas:
Copilot Actions Page: This is the central location where copilot actions are
managed and configured.
Record Page for the Copilot Action: From the record page, individual copilot

actions can be updated or modified.
Copilot Action Library Tab: This tab serves as a repository where predefined or
custom actions for Copilot can be accessed and modified.
These areas provide flexibility in managing and updating the actions assigned to
Copilot, ensuring that the AI assistant remains aligned with business
requirements and processes.
The other options are incorrect:
B misses the Copilot Action Library, which is crucial for managing actions.
C includes the Copilot Detail page, which isn't the primary place for action
management.

40.Coral Cloud Resorts needs consistent pass/fail logic for agent testing.
Which Testing Center capability provides that?
A. Use customer rating as a proxy for correctness.
B. Run a script on event logs to identify the failed utterances.
C. Use structured batch testing with validation per test utterance,
Answer: C
Explanation:
According to the AgentForce Testing Center Guide, structured batch testing is
the feature that provides consistent, repeatable pass/fail validation for agent
testing. The documentation explains: “Structured batch testing allows specialists
to define expected outputs per test utterance and automatically validate the
agent’s responses, resulting in deterministic pass/fail outcomes.”
This approach ensures testing consistency across multiple runs and
environments, unlike user ratings (Option A) which are subjective, or event log
scripts (Option B) which are manual and not standardized.
Thus, Option C is correct because structured batch testing provides Salesforce’s
official framework for validating agent accuracy with consistent logic.

B. Select the appropriate prompt template type to use, develop the prompt within
the prompt workspace, select resources to dynamically insert CRM-derived
grounding data, pick the model to use, and test and validate the generated
responses.
C. Enable the target object for generative prompting, develop the prompt within
the prompt workspace, select records to fine-tune and ground the response,
enable the Trust Layer, and associate the prompt to an action.
Answer: B
Explanation:
When using Prompt Builder in a Salesforce org, the correct process involves
several important steps:
Select the appropriate prompt template type based on the use case.
Develop the prompt within the prompt workspace, where the template is created
and customized.
Select CRM-derived grounding data to be dynamically inserted into the prompt,
ensuring that the AI-generated responses are based on accurate and relevant
data.
Pick the model to use for generating responses, either using Salesforce's built-in
models or custom ones.
Test and validate the generated responses to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
Option B is correct as it follows the proper steps for using Prompt Builder.
Option A and Option C do not capture the full process correctly.

42.What is best practice when refining Agent custom action instructions?
A. Provide examples of user messages that are expected to trigger the action.
B. Use consistent introductory phrases and verbs across multiple action
instructions.
C. Specify the persona who will request the action.
Answer: A
Explanation:
When refining Agent custom action instructions, it is considered best practice to
provide examples of user messages that are expected to trigger the action. This
helps ensure that the custom action understands a variety of user inputs and can
effectively respond to the intent behind the messages.
Option B (consistent phrases) can improve clarity but does not directly refine the
triggering logic.
Option C (specifying a persona) is not as crucial as giving examples that illustrate
how users will interact with the custom action.

43.Choose 1 option.
Universal Containers (UC) is setting up a new Agentforce Service Agent. The
company has sensitive medical product research stored internally and wants to
ensure the agent cannot access it.
What should UC da?
A. Assign the Agentforce Service Agent user the lowest possible role in the
organization's hierarchy to block access.
B. Disable the Agentforce Service Agent's ability to use any Salesforce custom
object or related fields.
C. Follow the principle of least privilege and avoid granting permission to view the
Medical Product object or related
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AgentForce Security and Access Control Best Practices Guide emphasizes
the principle of least privilege, which means granting each agent only the
permissions strictly necessary to perform its defined tasks.
To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data such as medical research,
administrators should exclude permissions for the Medical Product object and
related records from the AgentForce Service Agent’s permission set group. This
approach ensures that even if the reasoning engine processes a related query, it
cannot retrieve or expose data it lacks access to.
Option A is partially effective but not sufficient since Salesforce role hierarchy
does not fully restrict record access.
Option B is over-restrictive and would prevent legitimate operations involving
other custom objects.
Thus, the correct answer is Option C C Follow the principle of least privilege and
avoid granting permission to view the Medical Product object or related records.
Reference: AgentForce Administration and Security Guide ? “Applying Least
Privilege for Sensitive Data Protection.”


44.In Model Playground, which hyperparameters of an existing
Salesforce-enabled foundational model can An Agentforce change?
A. Temperature, Frequency Penalty, Presence Penalty
B. Temperature, Top-k sampling, Presence Penalty
C. Temperature, Frequency Penalty, Output Tokens
Answer: A


               Help You Pass Easily | Money Back Guarantee | Free Update in 3 Months | PDF & SOFT
                                            www.itfreedumps.com




Explanation:
In Model Playground, An Agentforce working with a Salesforce-enabled
foundational model has control over specific hyperparameters that can directly
affect the behavior of the generative model:
Temperature: Controls the randomness of predictions. A higher temperature
leads to more diverse outputs, while a lower temperature makes the model's
responses more focused and deterministic.
Frequency Penalty: Reduces the likelihood of the model repeating the same
phrases or outputs frequently.
Presence Penalty: Encourages the model to introduce new topics in its
responses, rather than sticking with familiar, previously mentioned content.
These hyperparameters are adjustable to fine-tune the model’s responses,
ensuring that it meets the desired behavior and use case requirements.
Salesforce documentation confirms that these three are the key tunable
hyperparameters in the Model Playground.
For more details, refer to Salesforce AI Model Playground guidance from
Salesforce’s official documentation on foundational model adjustments.


45.Universal Container's internal auditing team asks An Agentforce to verify that
address information is properly masked in the prompt being generated.
How should the Agentforce Specialist verify the privacy of the masked data in the
Einstein Trust Layer?
A. Enable data encryption on the address field
B. Review the platform event logs
C. Inspect the AI audit trail
Answer: C
Explanation:
The AI audit trail in Salesforce provides a detailed log of AI activities, including
the data used, its handling, and masking procedures applied in the Einstein Trust
Layer. It allows the Agentforce Specialist to inspect and verify that sensitive data,
such as addresses, is appropriately masked before being used in prompts or
outputs.
Enable data encryption on the address field: While encryption ensures data
security at rest or in transit, it does not verify masking in AI operations.
Review the platform event logs: Platform event logs capture system events but
do not specifically focus on the handling or masking of sensitive data in AI
processes.
Inspect the AI audit trail: This is the most relevant option, as it provides visibility
into how data is processed and masked in AI activities.
